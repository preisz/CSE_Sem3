    "\n",
    "A plate with piezoelectric patches is considered. The plate is fixed on the sides ($\\Gamma_{s}$) and has 3 piezoelectric patches attached on the front, as shown in the figures $1$ and $2$, to measure the response of the plate under different loading conditions. The piezoelectric patches are made up of the piezoceramic material PIC 255. Electrodes (of negligible thickness) are located on the top and bottom of the piezoceramic material, and it is insulated by an insulating material as shown in the figure $3$. The plate is made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and the dimensions are $l$ = 750 mm, $w$ = 450 mm, $t$ = 8 mm. The dimensions of the simplified model (used for modeling) of the piezoelectric patch are $l_{p}$ = 61 mm, $w_{p}$ = 35 mm, $t_{p}$ = 0.4 mm as shown in the figure $4$. "
